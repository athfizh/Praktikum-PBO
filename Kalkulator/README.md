# Modern Calculator Project

This is a modern calculator application built with Java Swing and FlatLaf.

## How to Run in VS Code

1.  **Open the Folder**: Open the `Kalkulator` folder in VS Code.
2.  **Wait for Java Extension**: VS Code's Java extension should automatically detect the `pom.xml` and download the necessary dependencies (FlatLaf).
3.  **Run**: Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/tugaskalkulator/Kalkulator.java` and click the "Run" button (or "Run Java").

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.
- Maven (usually handled by VS Code).
